<div style="padding-left: 315px"><p>Two people were killed in a major fire at the Crystal Tower residential apartments near Hindmata Cinema in Mumbai’s Parel area on Wednesday, an official at the KEM hospital said.
The fire that started from the 12th floor at 8.55 am was doused by 10.15 am. The fire brigade personnel are now checking every flat for trapped people. They are breaking latches and doors to enter the flats.</p>
<p>Deputy chief fire officer R Chaudhari said, “Height and congestion proved a major challenge in fire fighting. And the building’s fire fighting system was not working, so that is a major problem in dealing with highrise fires.”
Earlier cranes were used to rescue some of those trapped on top floors people. No injuries were reported but people were taken to KEM hospital for check ups. Two of those trapped were found unconscious.</p></div></p>

<p>He accompanied Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Rajnath Singh during their aerial survey of Kerala and has ensured that the Centre and the state worked in tandem at a difficult time.
